# ChatCompletionRequestToolChoice

Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. `none` means the model will not call any tool and instead generates a message. `auto` means the model can pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools. `any` or `required` means the model must call one or more tools. Specifying a particular tool via `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to call that tool.


## Supported Types

### `components.ToolChoice`

```typescript
const value: components.ToolChoice = {
  function: {
    name: "<value>",
  },
};
```

### `components.ToolChoiceEnum`

```typescript
const value: components.ToolChoiceEnum = "required";
```
